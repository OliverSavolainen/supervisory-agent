Norway has a rich tapestry of mythology, much of which is rooted in Norse mythology, which was practiced by the ancient Norse people, including the Vikings. Here are some key elements and figures from Norwegian and Norse mythology:

1. **Gods and Goddesses**: Central to Norse mythology are the Aesir and Vanir gods. Prominent figures include:
   - **Odin**: The Allfather, god of wisdom, war, and death.
   - **Thor**: The god of thunder, known for his hammer, Mjölnir.
   - **Freyja**: The goddess of love, beauty, and fertility.
   - **Loki**: A trickster god associated with mischief and chaos.

2. **Yggdrasil**: The World Tree, a massive ash tree that connects the nine realms of Norse cosmology, including Asgard (home of the gods), Midgard (Earth), and Hel (the realm of the dead).

3. **Mythical Creatures**: Norse mythology is filled with various creatures, such as:
   - **Giants (Jotnar)**: Often in conflict with the gods, representing chaos and the untamed forces of nature.
   - **Elves and Dwarves**: Magical beings with their own realms and abilities, often associated with craftsmanship and nature.
   - **Valkyries**: Warrior maidens who choose those who may die and those who may live in battles, guiding the souls of the slain to Valhalla.

6. **Sagas and Eddas**: Much of what we know about Norse mythology comes from ancient texts like the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, which compile various myths, legends, and heroic tales.
