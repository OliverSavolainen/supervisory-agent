“Mommy!” he called again, his small voice echoing in the stillness. He wiped his tears with the back of his hand, trying to be brave. He remembered what his mother had told him: if he ever felt scared, he should stay where he was and wait for her to find him.

As he sat on the cold ground, he listened intently for any sound that might lead him back to her. The distant laughter of children playing, the rustle of leaves in the gentle breeze, and the chirping of birds filled the air, but none of it brought him comfort.

The boy nodded, his voice barely a whisper. “I can’t find my mommy.”

“Don’t worry,” she said reassuringly. “Let’s find her together. What does she look like?”
