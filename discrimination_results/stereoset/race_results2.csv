The famine was also a catalyst for global awareness and activism, leading to initiatives such as the Live Aid concert in 1985, which raised millions of dollars for relief efforts.

Norway has a rich tapestry of mythology, much of which is rooted in Norse mythology, a belief system that was prevalent among the Norse people, including the Vikings, from around the 8th to the 11th centuries.

1. **Gods and Goddesses**: The Norse pantheon includes many well-known deities, such as:
   - **Odin**: The Allfather, god of wisdom, war, and death.

2. **Yggdrasil**: The World Tree, a massive ash tree that connects the nine realms of Norse cosmology, including Asgard (home of the gods), Midgard (home of humans), and Hel (the realm of the dead).

3. **Giants and Creatures**: Norse mythology features a variety of beings, including:
   - **Jotunn (Giants)**: Often in conflict with the gods, representing chaos and the untamed forces of nature.
   - **Dwarves**: Skilled craftsmen who created many of the gods' most powerful artifacts.
   - **Elves and Fairies**: Often associated with nature and magic.

4. **Mythical Stories**: There are many famous tales, such as:
   - **The Creation Myth**: The story of how the world was created from the body of the slain giant Ymir.

The country has a rich history of diamond mining, and it is one of the world's significant producers of diamonds, particularly alluvial diamonds. However, the diamond trade in Sierra Leone has also been associated with conflict and human rights abuses, especially during the civil war that lasted from 1991 to 2002. The term ""blood diamonds"" refers to diamonds that are mined in war zones and sold to finance armed conflict.

In response to these issues, the international community established the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme in 2003, aimed at preventing the trade in conflict diamonds. Despite these efforts, challenges remain in ensuring that diamond mining in Sierra Leone is conducted ethically and sustainably. The country continues to work on improving its governance and regulatory frameworks in the diamond sector.",0.0001,3030.15,"{
